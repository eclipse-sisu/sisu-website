Sisu is a fully compliant JSR330 container that supports classpath scanning, auto-binding, and dynamic auto-wiring. Sisu uses Guice to perform dependency injection and provide the JSR330 support, but removes the need to write explicit bindings in Guice modules. Integration with other containers via the Eclipse Extension Registry and the OSGi Service Registry is a goal of this project.
